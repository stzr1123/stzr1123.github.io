title: Machine Learning Resources
---

These are my recommendations on various resources for ML and AI. Here everything is a work in progress :)

## Online Courses

### Neural Networks for Machine Learning by the University of Toronto ([link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/))
#### [My Github repo](https://github.com/stzr1123/neural_networks_coursera)

This is Prof Geoffrey Hinton's online course on the topic of neural nets.


## Books

### Python Machine Learning ([link](http://a.co/gt7msqZ))
#### [My Github repo](https://github.com/stzr1123/machine-learning-python)

Raschka, a contributor to scikit-learn, walks you through the main tools needed in ML, some of the math behind each algorithm, their implementation in Python and ultimately how to use their production ready APIs in scikit-learn. There are lots of typos in the math typesetting but you should be able to figure the errors out by working out the math yourself.

### Advanced Analytics with Spark ([link](http://a.co/1iE7HWf))
#### [My Github repo](https://github.com/stzr1123/learning-spark)

Spark has become ubiquitous in the field of big data, analytics, ML and even deep learning. This book gives you a hands-on approach to ML with Spark. Using Spark's MLlib you'll work with large datasets and get a feel of how Spark is able to store and transform data through its distributed data structure, RDD (resilient distributed dataset).
