TODAY is in many ways exactly the point in my life where I wanted to be for quite a long time. I graduated from college after working through my hardest academic year. A year which finalized with a great personal sense of accomplishment, seeing all those countless hours of (mostly solitary) study in the library get summed up to an arbitrary level where one can be considered *educated*[^footnote_one]. In the last months prior to graduation, I’d walk around in big and slow circles in the science library's stacks, an activity I normally engage in to trigger big-picture reflective thinking, and recognize how far I have come from the day I stepped into a new country and culture (the US). 

College was this mental tour through forests of knowledge which I had finally exited from but not without having been changed by it (noting how cliché this sounds). One of its greatest legacies is a sense of preparedness to be able to take on whatever lies ahead of me. But it is not just the culmination of college that makes today a time long held in anticipation. The completion of a very different kind of tour which saw me cycle from San Francisco to Seattle is also what made me think of this time dearly.

In many ways the cycling trip was the antithesis of college: if college wraps you and holds you within the safety and predictability of routine and campus life, a cycling trip throws you into a changing coast of treacherous weather patterns. The cycling trip provided me with more opportunities to work in a team, lose sight of myself in favor of others or of my surroundings and engage with a material reality as opposed to a conceptual framework.

I’ve grown from these experiences as only someone who has experienced them first hand can grow. It is today that I find myself at a point where the foundations are laid under me and I’m ready to build upon them. Also appreciating the fact that those foundations are not forever immutable and that future growth could potentially reshape them.

Today, I am ready to engage the world in whichever way I choose to. Concretely speaking this means I can put my foot on the door in any field I wish to develop professionally, work on my own projects, navigate my aspirations with the leverage of a college education, be free to live and work in the EU where I can enjoy the benefits of being a full citizen unrestrained from the thoughts of knowing I didn't have an education, keep adventuring, etc.

To think there were nights not too long ago where this point in time seemed like an eternity away but spacetime, bringing time forward at the unstoppable rate of one second per second as it always does and always will, has brought us here nonetheless.
