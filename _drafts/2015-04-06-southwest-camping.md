>*"Stepping into wilderness and looking past ourselves, we see the vivid space of great forests, mountains, rivers, and deserts. You might say the wilderness experience gives us a standard by which to measure our sanity ... [It] calls out the wilderness inside ourselves, and we're always surprised by its sane and gentle nature."* —Albert Saijo


For the week of March 21st, I ventured on a camping trip through the Southwest with a group of seven UofC students. These are the things we've seen...


## Saturday
<h4><em>"Who's driving next?"</em></h4>

After driving through two Springfields (IL and MO), a Miami with no beaches (OK), and 1,500 miles, we cruised the 23hr journey from Hyde Park, Chicago to Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. We shared the driving among three of us in the four people car, taking 3.5 hour shifts on average. It was a long night, the XM radio stations were generally pretty terrible and we still didn't really know each other. But the passing of each additional mile brewed in all of us the excitement of what was waiting at the end of this road.

## Sunday
<h4>Petrified Forest, AZ</h4>

>Waking up to the highway in New Mexico was like finding myself down the rabbit hole to Wonderland, a Wonderland that looked like a Wild West cowboy movie.

Our first meaningful stop was at a gas station in the small community of Continental Divide, NM. The beauty was aggressive.

We eventually arrived at Petrified Forest and began hiking.

Petrified Wood
: It is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having completely transitioned to stone by the process of permineralization. All the organic materials have been replaced with minerals (mostly a silicate, such as quartz), while retaining the original structure of the stem tissue. —Wikipedia

That night I was able to do some great star photography.

## Monday
<h4>Petrified Forest &#8594; Tucson &#8594; Saguaro National Park, AZ</h4>

>Wake up at 7am. Pack up. Leave no trace. Drive 300 miles to Saguaro. Hike 6.3 miles up 2,000ft of elevation. Camp for the night. Did I mention there are rattlesnakes? Or that it'll be close to nighttime by the time we get to the trailhead? Yeah...

<p align="right"><em>We saw so many species of cacti (while there was still light out).</em></p>

## Tuesday
<h4>Only half way up there</h4>

>After hiking all day and almost running out of drinking water, we thought we were still 3 miles away from Manning Camp. In reality, we had already summited and were just a mile away.

<p align="right"><em>Close to the summit, around 8,000ft. 4G coverage.</em></p>

## Wednesday
<h4>Hiking Saguaro downhill and camping at Gila National Forest, NM</h4>

>A married couple on the trail greets me and say, *"The girls ahead of you said they've seen a rattlesnake on the side of the trail by the rocks. It's probably gone now."*<br>
Receiving some words of reassurance.

After descending Saguaro (crazy fast) during the morning, we embarked to Gila National Forest. It was a 240 mile ride through some zig zagging roads towards the end. No pictures today.

## Thursday
<h4>Visiting the Cliff Dwellings and camping at Lincoln National Forest, NM</h4>

>[phone vibrates] Text message reads: *"There is an immigration checkpoint exiting El Paso. Have your passports ready!"*<br>

Realizing that we were very late visitors to these arid and hostile lands was one of the greatest parts of the trip. For that Cliff Dwellings, thank you.

<p align="right"><em>About the area: "This field is dominated by a number of supervolcanoes that erupted between 28 and 35 million years ago."</em></p>

<p align="right"><em>Puebloans of the Mogollon Area: "The ancient Puebloan people who built these cliff dwellings belonged to a larger tradition that included part of what is now Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and northern Mexico."</em></p>

Later that day we could have crossed the border into Mexico as we drove from Gila to Lincoln National Forest going through El Paso, TX.

We camped the night at Lincoln to be close to the caverns by next morning. It took us one hour to bring the water to a boil that night.

## Friday
<h4>Into the darkness (Carlsbad Caverns, NM)</h4>

>I've read you can fit Notre-Dame Cathedral with all its bells and towers inside the Big Room in the caverns...I didn't believe it at first but then I believed it.

<iframe src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/stefanzachar/16808648107/in/album-72157651715917671/player/" width="600" height="800" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>
<p align="right"><em>We'd think about what it'd be like to explore the caves for the very first time, way back when they were just a curiosity in a caver's mind.</em></p>

<p align="right"><em>Not only can it hold Notre-Dame but it looks pretty Gothic too.</em></p>

<p align="right"><em>Petrified cheese.</em></p>

## Saturday
<h4>Back in Chicago by noon and <em>"I'm so taking a shower right now"</em></h4>

>It is never the end of a camping trip. Just an indefinite water break till the next one.

And so the trip drew to a happy and safe end as we got back to Chicago, to resume the lives we lead.

<p align="right">The End.</p>

<h4>Some departing thoughts</h4>

* This time, we didn't get Giardia.
* You can see the full album for the trip [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stefanzachar/sets/72157651715917671/).
* I like to think that the wind turbines in the last picture represent each one of the eight people on the trip. But there's a ninth one...
